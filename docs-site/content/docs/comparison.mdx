## Feature Comparison

| Feature | snpm | npm | yarn | pnpm |
|---------|------|-----|------|------|
| **Global Cache** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Lockfile Format** | YAML | JSON | YAML | YAML |
| **Workspaces** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Catalog Protocol** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Minimum Version Age** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Written In** | Rust | JavaScript | JavaScript | JavaScript |
| **Parallel Downloads** | ✅ | Limited | ✅ | ✅ |

## Key Differences

### Global Store

Like pnpm, snpm uses a global store to cache packages. Download once, reuse everywhere.

**Location:** `~/.snpm-store`

### Lockfile

snpm uses YAML for its lockfile (`snpm-lock.yaml`), making it easy to read and review in pull requests.

### Catalog Protocol

Define dependency versions once in `snpm-catalog.yaml` and reference them across your workspace. Eliminates version drift in monorepos.

### Minimum Version Age

Unique to snpm: configure it to ignore recently published package versions. This protects against zero-day malicious packages and broken releases.

```bash
export SNPM_MIN_VERSION_AGE_DAYS=7
```

### Written in Rust

Fast, memory-efficient, and reliable. The codebase is designed to be readable and maintainable.

## Command Comparison

| Task | npm | snpm |
|------|-----|------|
| Install dependencies | `npm install` | `snpm install` |
| Add package | `npm install <pkg>` | `snpm add <pkg>` |
| Remove package | `npm uninstall <pkg>` | `snpm remove <pkg>` |
| Update packages | `npm update` | `snpm upgrade` |
| Run script | `npm run <script>` | `snpm run <script>` |
| Check outdated | `npm outdated` | `snpm outdated` |

## Why Choose snpm?

**Speed** - Global caching and parallel operations make installs fast.

**Security** - Minimum version age protects against supply chain attacks.

**Simplicity** - Readable lockfile, familiar commands, no surprises.

**Workspaces** - First-class monorepo support with catalog protocol.

**Reliability** - Written in Rust for performance and stability.

## Migration

Switching from npm/yarn/pnpm is straightforward:

1. Install snpm
2. Delete `node_modules` and old lockfiles
3. Run `snpm install`

Your `package.json` works as-is. No changes needed.
