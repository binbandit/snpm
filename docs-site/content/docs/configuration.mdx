Configure snpm's behavior through environment variables and configuration files.

## Environment Variables

snpm can be configured using environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SNPM_REGISTRY` | Registry URL | `https://registry.npmjs.org` |
| `SNPM_STORE_PATH` | Global store location | `~/.snpm-store` |
| `SNPM_MIN_VERSION_AGE_DAYS` | Minimum package age in days | `0` |
| `SNPM_MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` | Max parallel downloads | System dependent |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | Registry authentication token | - |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use custom registry
export SNPM_REGISTRY=https://npm.mycompany.com

# Custom store location
export SNPM_STORE_PATH=/custom/store

# Set minimum version age (security feature)
export SNPM_MIN_VERSION_AGE_DAYS=7

# Increase concurrent downloads
export SNPM_MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=20
```

## Registry Configuration

### Default Registry

```bash
export SNPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmjs.org
```

### Private Registry

```bash
export SNPM_REGISTRY=https://npm.mycompany.com
export NPM_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

Or use the login command:

```bash
snpm login --registry https://npm.mycompany.com
```

### Scoped Registries

```bash
snpm login --scope @myorg --registry https://npm.mycompany.com
```

## Store Configuration

The global store caches downloaded packages for reuse across projects.

**Default Location:**
- macOS/Linux: `~/.snpm-store`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.snpm-store`

**Custom Location:**

```bash
export SNPM_STORE_PATH=/custom/store
```

## Security Configuration

### Minimum Version Age

Protect against zero-day malicious packages by ignoring recently published versions:

```bash
export SNPM_MIN_VERSION_AGE_DAYS=7
```

This makes snpm ignore any package version published within the last 7 days.

<Callout type="info">
  This is a unique security feature that helps protect against supply chain attacks.
</Callout>

## Network Configuration

### Concurrent Downloads

Control how many packages download simultaneously:

```bash
export SNPM_MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=20
```

Higher values speed up installs but use more network bandwidth.

## Common Configurations

### Development

Fast installs, no restrictions:

```bash
export SNPM_MIN_VERSION_AGE_DAYS=0
export SNPM_MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=20
```

### Production

Secure and deterministic:

```bash
export SNPM_MIN_VERSION_AGE_DAYS=7
```

Use `--frozen-lockfile` in CI:

```bash
snpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

### CI/CD

Fast and reproducible:

```bash
export SNPM_MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=50
snpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Workspace Configuration

Workspaces are configured via `snpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml title="snpm-workspace.yaml"
packages:
  - 'packages/*'
  - 'apps/*'
```

## Catalog Configuration

Dependency versions are managed via `snpm-catalog.yaml`:

```yaml title="snpm-catalog.yaml"
react: ^18.2.0
typescript: ^5.0.0

build:
  vite: ^5.0.0
```

See the Catalog documentation for details.
