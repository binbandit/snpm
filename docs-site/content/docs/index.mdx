description: Welcome to snpm - the Speedy Node Package Manager
---

**snpm** is a fast, simple, and deterministic package manager written in Rust. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for npm, yarn, and pnpm.

<Callout type="info">
  **Status:** snpm is functional and ready for use, but still in active development. Core features work reliably, but some advanced features are still being refined.

## Why snpm?

Built with a strict "no cleverness" rule, snpm focuses on making the existing npm workflow **faster**, **simpler**, and **easier to maintain**.

### Core Features

- **Familiar Commands** - `snpm install`, `snpm add`, `snpm run` work exactly like npm
- **Global Store** - Download packages once, reuse them across all projects
- **Parallel Operations** - Network and disk operations run in parallel for speed
- **Workspace Support** - First-class monorepo support with `snpm-workspace.yaml`
- **Catalog Protocol** - Define dependency versions once in `snpm-catalog.yaml`
- **Clean Lockfile** - Simple, readable `snpm-lock.yaml` format
- **Minimum Version Age** - Protect against zero-day malicious packages

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install snpm
npm install -g snpm

# Use it like npm
snpm install
snpm add react
snpm run build
```

## How It Works

**Global Store** - Packages are downloaded once to `~/.snpm-store` and linked into your projects. This saves disk space and speeds up subsequent installs.

**Parallelism** - Multiple packages download simultaneously, and disk operations are optimized for speed.

**Workspaces** - Detects `snpm-workspace.yaml` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and efficiently manages dependencies across multiple packages in a monorepo.

**Catalog Protocol** - Define versions in `snpm-catalog.yaml` and reference them with `catalog:` in your `package.json` to eliminate version drift.
