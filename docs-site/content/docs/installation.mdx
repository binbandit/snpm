Get snpm installed and ready to use.

## Install with npm (Recommended)

The easiest way to install snpm:

```bash
npm install -g snpm
```

This installs the `snpm` binary globally on your system.

<Callout type="info">
  This installs a pre-built binary, so you don't need Rust installed.
</Callout>

## Install from Source

If you prefer to build from source:

**Prerequisites:**
- Rust toolchain (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- Git

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/binbandit/snpm.git
cd snpm

# Build and install
cargo install --path snpm-cli
```

This installs the `snpm` binary to your Cargo bin directory (usually `~/.cargo/bin`).

## Verify Installation

```bash
snpm --version
```

## Update snpm

**If installed via npm:**

```bash
npm update -g snpm
```

**If installed from source:**

```bash
cd snpm
git pull
cargo install --path snpm-cli
```

## Uninstall

**If installed via npm:**

```bash
npm uninstall -g snpm
```

**If installed from source:**

```bash
cargo uninstall snpm-cli
```
