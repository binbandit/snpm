# Roadmap

This page lists the features we expect snpm to have, ordered by priority. We are building a pnpm killer, so we aim to match their feature set before surpassing them.

## Implemented

Features that are already available in the current version of snpm.

- [x] **Basic CLI** (`install`, `add`, `remove`, `run`)
- [x] **Production installs** (`--production` flag)
- [x] **Global Store** with parallel downloads
- [x] **Lockfile** (`snpm-lock.yaml`) read/write and reuse
- [x] **Semver support** (including `latest` and `||` ranges)
- [x] **`node_modules` linking** with `.bin` support
- [x] **Initial workspace support** (detection and multi-project install)

## Planned

Upcoming features and improvements, ordered by priority.

### Refine Store & Linking
- [ ] Reduce disk usage by symlinking from the store where safe
- [ ] Optionally move toward a virtual store layout

### First-class Workspaces
- [ ] Resolve local packages before going to the registry
- [ ] Single lockfile for the entire workspace
- [ ] Commands like `snpm add -w <pkg>` to target specific workspace packages

### Lockfile Modes
- [ ] `--frozen-lockfile` / `--immutable` for CI
- [ ] Clear errors when the manifest does not match the lockfile

### Quality of Life
- [ ] `snpm init` to bootstrap projects
- [ ] `snpm outdated` / `snpm upgrade`
- [ ] Better error messages and suggestions

### Performance Tuning
- [ ] Throttling concurrent downloads for huge dependency trees
- [ ] Smarter reuse of resolution graphs within a workspace
