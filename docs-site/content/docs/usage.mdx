snpm works just like npm. If you know npm, you already know snpm.

## Installing Dependencies

```bash
snpm install
```

Reads `package.json`, resolves dependencies, downloads packages to the global store, and links them to `node_modules`.

**Options:**
- `--production` - Skip dev dependencies
- `--frozen-lockfile` - Fail if lockfile needs updates (useful for CI)
- `--force` - Force re-download all packages

```bash
# Production install
snpm install --production

# CI install (fail if lockfile is out of sync)
snpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Adding Packages

```bash
snpm add <package>
```

Adds a package to `dependencies` and installs it.

```bash
# Add a package
snpm add react

# Add specific version
snpm add react@18.2.0

# Add as dev dependency
snpm add -D typescript

# Add multiple packages
snpm add react react-dom
```

## Removing Packages

```bash
snpm remove <package>
```

Removes a package from `package.json` and `node_modules`.

```bash
snpm remove react
snpm remove react react-dom
```

## Running Scripts

```bash
snpm run <script>
```

Runs a script defined in `package.json`.

```bash
# Run build script
snpm run build

# Pass arguments (use -- to separate)
snpm run test -- --watch
```

## Upgrading Packages

```bash
snpm upgrade
```

Updates all packages to their latest versions within semver constraints.

```bash
# Upgrade all packages
snpm upgrade

# Upgrade specific packages
snpm upgrade react react-dom

# Upgrade production dependencies only
snpm upgrade --production
```

## Checking for Updates

```bash
snpm outdated
```

Shows which packages have newer versions available.

```bash
# Check all dependencies
snpm outdated

# Check production dependencies only
snpm outdated --production
```

## Global Store

Packages are downloaded once to `~/.snpm-store` and reused across all projects. This saves disk space and makes subsequent installs much faster.

## Lockfile

`snpm-lock.yaml` ensures deterministic installs. Always commit it to version control.
